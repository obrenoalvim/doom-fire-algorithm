# doom-fire-algorithm - KOF

Fire effect from DOOM in [Kof](https://github.com/KofLang/Kof4j), a new statically-typed language that targets JVM, native and web from the same source.

Same propagation logic as the original: bottom row seeded at max intensity, each pixel copies the one below it with random decay and a slight horizontal drift, mapped through a 36-step palette. Rendered as 24-bit ANSI background colors, two spaces per cell.

## Requirements

- [Kof](https://github.com/KofLang/Kof4j/releases) (0.3.x-beta or later)

## Running

```
git clone https://github.com/filipedeschamps/doom-fire-algorithm.git
cd doom-fire-algorithm/playground/kof-implementation
kof run Main.kf --target jvm
```

Ctrl+C to stop, it loops forever.

## More

A bilingual (PT/EN) browser build with a live fire-intensity slider, served by Kof's own `kof.web`, plus the terminal build above: [obrenoalvim/doom-fire-kof](https://github.com/obrenoalvim/doom-fire-kof).
